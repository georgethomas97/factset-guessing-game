# Factset Guessing Game Code

This repository contains the code for the guessing game program. The application has been developed using Maven to necessitate easier dependency management. There are two main directories in the project namely: src/main/java directory which contains the application files and a corresponding src/test/java which contains the test files.The program has been divided into multiple classes spanning across two main packages to ensure a standard structure.

# Setup Instructions

In order to run the program, you can download/clone the repository and then import the GuessingProgram directory as a maven project into your IDE and then start the GuessingGameLauncher class (located in the com.game.guesser.client package inside src/main/java) as a Java Application.
